# CLI Convert â€” Command-Line File Validator and Converter

**CLI Convert** is a tool written in **Go (Golang)** that allows you to validate and process files directly from the command line, with planned support for converting between multiple data formats (such as JSON â†’ CSV, XML, YAML, etc.).

Currently, the project validates the structure of the input file and displays the provided parameters, serving as a foundation for future format conversion features.

## Features

* **JSON File Validation**

  Checks whether the file exists, is not empty, and contains valid JSON data.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

  Supports the parameters `--input`, `--output`, `--from`, and `--to`.
* **Extensible Architecture**

  Modular design makes it easy to add new format conversion functions in the future.
