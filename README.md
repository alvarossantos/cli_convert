# CLI Convert â€” Command-Line File Validator and Converter

**CLI Convert** is a tool written in **Go (Golang)** that allows you to validate and process files directly from the command line, with planned support for converting between multiple data formats (such as JSON â†’ CSV, XML, YAML, etc.).

Currently, the project validates the structure of the input file and displays the provided parameters, serving as a foundation for future format conversion features.

## Features

* **File Validation**

  Checks whether the file exists, is not empty, and contains valid data.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

  Supports the parameters `--input`, `--output`, `--from`, and `--to`.
* **Extensible Architecture**

  Modular design makes it easy to add new format conversion functions in the future.

### ðŸ“„ Project Description

**CLI Convert** is a lightweight and extensible command-line utility built with **Go (Golang)** for validating and processing data files.

Its main purpose is to provide a simple interface to check the integrity of JSON files and prepare the foundation for future data format conversions such as  **JSON â†’ CSV** ,  **JSON â†’ XML** , or  **YAML â†’ JSON** .

The tool includes a flexible CLI interface that accepts custom parameters for input and output paths, as well as source and target data formats.

With a clean and modular code structure, developers can easily extend it to support new file types or additional validation and transformation logic.

**Key Highlights:**

* Written in Go, focusing on performance and portability.
* Validates file existence, size, and JSON structure integrity.
* Easily extensible to handle multiple data formats.
* Provides a simple command-line interface with intuitive flags.

**Example usage:**

```
Terminal:

go build
./cli-convert --input input.json --output output.csv --from json --to csv
```
